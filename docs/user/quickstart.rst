Quickstart Guide
================

Getting Started with Jeeves
---------------------------

Getting your first Jeeves bot up and running is extremely quick. Once you've :ref:`installed <install>` the framework you can connect to an IRC channel with 3 commands:

::

    $ jeeves-admin.py startbot examplebot
    $ cd examplebot
    $ python bot.py runbot

This will connect your bot to #jeeves on `irc.freenode.net`.

Extending Jeeves
----------------

In most cases, creating your own :ref:`plugins <plugins>` will be enough for your to customize your bot. If you find that the framework doesn't do something you need it to do or you have a really cool plugin that you wish to share you can check out the :ref:`contribution guide <contribute>` to see how you can contribute your changes back.
